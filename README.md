## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Here I learn how to set the position to fixed. absolute, relative, and static. The problem with using this is that every element on every screen changes. If the height of the screen size is often ignored because it is rarely affected, but here it is very influential. So? be careful with your position. LOL


### Continued development

If you use a different screen than mine, there may be changes. This is what I will develop next, responsive to screens with different widths and heights.
